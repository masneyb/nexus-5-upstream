Here's a list in no particular order of various TODO items to get the major phone components
working upstream. Please [let me know](mailto:masneyb@onstation.org) (or send a pull request) if you
have any updates to this list. Feel free to pick up an item on this list if you're interested.

- GPU - I'm currently working on upstreaming the various bits to support the GPU upstream. See the
  [linux repository on my GitHub account](https://github.com/masneyb/linux/branches) for the
  current work in progress. Needs IOMMU support upstream.
- Slimbus to support showing the phone screen on an external TV / monitor. There is now Qualcomm
  code in the
  [slimbus subsystem upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/qcom/linux.git/tree/drivers/slimbus).
  I have some work in progress patches on the main page of this repository that works towards
  getting this working. More troubleshooting is needed to determine why the external display
  is not working.
- Front and back camera - Appears to be supported by out-of-tree patch set for the
  [Qualcomm Camera Control Interface](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/825398/). This will
  require additional changes to the OCMEM support upstream since it only supports the GPU.
- Audio - Requires additional OCMEM code upstream.
- GPS - Patch for gpsd is in [this tree](https://github.com/andersson/gpsd/commits/master) for the
  Qualcomm PDS service support. Start gpsd with `sudo gpsd -N -D9 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock` and
  connect to it with `sudo gpsdctl add pds://any`, and test with `sudo gpsmon`.
- Rear flashlight - [NÃ­colas](https://github.com/nfraprado) is currently working on upstreaming the driver.
  There is an [RFC PATCH](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20201106165737.1029106-1-nfraprado@protonmail.com/T/#md240cd09d8860b9eb1dcf641366a454d14a73c02)
  that already works but still needs a lot of clean up.
- The front LED appears to be supported by an out-of-tree patch with the
  [Qualcomm Light Pulse Generator (LPG) driver](https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/15/26).
- CPUFreq support for msm8974. See [this message](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190812152826.GA7958@centauri/)
  for more details. The referenced patch in linux-next is titled
  'cpufreq: qcom: Re-organise kryo cpufreq to use it for other nvmem based qcom socs'.

## Driver improvements

- lm3630a backlight - Move the config structures out of include/linux/platform_data since there
  are no in-tree users and require device tree instead.
- tsl2772 ALS / proximity sensor - runtime power management. I have a work in progress patch for
  this. Need to investigate how to support this when interrupt thesholds are configured.
- Check other IIO devices supported by this board to see if runtime power management is present.
