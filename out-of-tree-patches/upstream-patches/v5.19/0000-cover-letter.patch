Subject: [PATCH 0/7] ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974-hammerhead: add GPU and
 vibrator support
Content-type: text/plain

Patches 1-3 in this series are the minimum set of patches that are
needed in order to get the GPU working on the Nexus 5.

Patches 4-6 gets the force feedback vibrator working on the Nexus 5.
Note that as of 2021 that upstream now implements the
clk_rcg2_set_duty_cycle() function in drivers/clk/qcom/clk-rcg2.c. I
suspect that some calculation may not be working as expected on
msm8974. I observe the following behavior when I run rumble-test with
the following parameters:

    0x0000        - off
    0x1111        - high
    0x2222-0x6666 - goes from high to low
    0x7777-0x8888 - off (or close to off)
    0x9999-0xffff - goes from low to high

With the patch
../v5.12/0001-clk-qcom-add-support-for-setting-the-duty-cycle.patch the
duty cycle does a consistent low to high. I have not looked into this
issue any further beyond documenting this behavior.

A more complete set of out-of-tree patches is available from the
postmarketOS developers at:
