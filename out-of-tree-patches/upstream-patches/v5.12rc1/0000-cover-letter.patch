Subject: [PATCH 0/9] qcom: Nexus 5 out-of-tree patches for v5.6

Here's my v5.12 patch series with my out-of-tree patches for the Nexus 5
phone.

- Patches 1-5 are to get the vibrator working. I'm waiting for someone
  from Qualcomm to post support for setting the clock duty cycle for
  the Qualcomm clocks since the m, n, and d clock values are
  undocumented.

- Patch 6 CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT is a hack to support that way that I do
  kernel development for this project.

- Patch 7 needs more investigation why delaying rpm init fixes some boot
  issues.

- Patch 8 enables the GPU for the Nexus 5. The issue related to patch 7
  needs to be fixed before this patch can go upstream.

- Patch 9 enabled debugfs and the modem in qcom_defconfig.

Brian Masney (8):
  clk: qcom: add support for setting the duty cycle
  dt-bindings: Input: introduce new clock vibrator bindings
  Input: introduce new clock vibrator driver
  ARM: qcom_defconfig: enable clk-vibrator driver
  ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974-hammerhead: add support for vibrator
  disable CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT
  ARM: dts: qcom: msm8974-hammerhead: add support for GPU
  add debugfs and modem options to qcom_defconfig
